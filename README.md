**Coding Challengue**

**Author: Cristhiam Daniel Campos Julca**

It is suggested to follow the following route for reading and understanding the development of the application:

1. ```README_entry_level.md```: File where the challenge provided by the company and the requirements of said challenge are found.
2. ```CodingChallenge.ipynb```: Notebook that provides the development of the candidate functions to solve the challenge. In addition, complexity analysis is provided through runtime graphs as the input size increases significantly. At the end, the best proposal for the development of the application is selected. Likewise, an analysis is carried out to adjust the curves to mathematical models according to the behavior of each graph.
3. ```analisis.pdf```: File that shows the behavior of the candidate functions in the worst case according to the algorithms they have implemented.
4. ```functions.py```: Python file that stores all the auxiliary functions that will be used in the following file.
5. ```main.py```: Python file that returns the graphs mentioned in step 2. It also saves the execution times of each function in a dataframe.
6. ```testApp.ipynb```: Notebook that shows how we implement the function selected in step 5, inside the final application. 4 scripts are shown where it is shown how the lines of code are reduced and a cleaner code is obtained.
7. ```file```: External file where lists of numbers followed by the target value are stored.
8. ```app.py```: Application main file. The object-oriented programming paradigm is used.
